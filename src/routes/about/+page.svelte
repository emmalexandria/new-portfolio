<H1>About me</H1>


<P>
    My name is Emma Alexandria. My legal name is longer, but I don’t use it on websites because it doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. I’m a software developer from Cape Town with a particular interest in web development, web design, and terminal tooling. I particularly enjoy the feeling of finishing a project. There’s little more satisfying to me than putting out a completed code base with a title, logo, and detailed usage documentation. I’m passionate about web accessibility standards and the development of an open and safe internet. 

I’ve had an interest in the technical complexities of computing from a very young age. I see computers as an essential engine for human progress and perhaps in time the most significant invention humanity has produced. I also enjoy formal writing and typesetting documents.

<H2>Skills</H2>
    <P>
My main skills lie in web development, particularly with Svelte, Typescript, and Tailwind. However, I also have significant experience with Rust, and some experience with C#, Java, Go, and Python. Further, I have some basic experience with data visualization and graphics development. 

I have a strong basis in the fundamentals of computing, and I am a proficient Linux user. My most significant asset is that when it comes to computers I’m an extremely fast and intuitive learner. 

I’m also a regular user of the Adobe suite, DaVinci Resolve, and Latex.

<H2>Interests</H2>
<P>
    In my free time I enjoy editing Wikipedia, creating and typesetting personal writing, listening to albums, and writing code.
